Over the years, I've collected resources that have been instrumental in my learning journey. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your skills, I hope you find these as helpful as I did.

## Getting Started with Programming

If you're new to programming, these resources will give you a solid foundation in C and C++:

- [Neso Academy C Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OGMB4Fhh50&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhX6r2uhhlubuF5QextdCSM) - Comprehensive video series covering C fundamentals
- [HackerRank C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp) - Practice problems to strengthen your C++ skills
- [HackerRank Problem Solving](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=problem-solving) - Build problem-solving intuition with hands-on challenges

## Data Structures & Algorithms

Understanding DSA is crucial for technical interviews and competitive programming. These resources offer both theory and practice:

- [MIT OpenCourseWare - Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) - World-class lectures from MIT professors
