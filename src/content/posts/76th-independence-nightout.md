## ...
Background: Archishman saw a massaging neck pillow before.  
## ...

We, 5 guys, were roaming in the ladies and babies section searching for a neck pillow/ neck rest.  
Archishman saw a neck pillow, and wanted to get one.  
We see some neck pillows which **DO NOT VIBRATE**. ```(one also had kitty on it :) )```

At last, without finding any Neck rest, we end up at spencers not expecting to get one there either.  
## But
We found one but it still does not vibrate. But Dhara had to make sure.  
So, He asks the counter lady.  
Dhara: **DOES IT VIBRATE?**  
Counter Lady ```( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)```: No.

Defeinitely not a good look. :/
